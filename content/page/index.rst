The **Transport Data Commons Initiative (TDCI)** aims to provide accessible, meaningful data that is readily used by stakeholders worldwide working on sustainable, low-carbon development of transport and mobility—especially those in, and supporting, developing countries.

Through creating a **Transport Data Commons (TDC)**, we envision that:

- Existing data can be easily accessed and used for assessment, modelling, and cross-checking.
  Time-consuming, often duplicated work—to collate, collect, extract, and transform data from highly fragmented sources—will be greatly reduced.
- Data that is newly created (e.g. collected as part of development projects; or projected from scientific models) can be made broadly available and reach many users; not buried in appendices to project reports.
- Peers can directly discuss with one another to identify issues of data quality and propose solutions for constructing improved data; these improved data can be quickly generated and shared.

The TDC will comprise, *inter alia*:

- A web presence with features for:

  - Interactive exploration, visualization, and download by data consumers.
  - Submission of data and/or metadata by data providers.

- Guidelines for interoperable, reusable transport data and metadata. [1]_
- An :raw-html:`<abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>` for programmatic access to data. [1]_
- Tools and automation for data update, cleaning, and harmonization, according to steps identified by TDCI partners.
